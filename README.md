# VoiceCube

A modern voice recognition assistant that responds to voice commands through your browser. This project implements a speech recognition interface with various commands and features.

## Project Roadmap

### ðŸŸ¢ Phase 1 â€“ Basic Voice Recognition
- [x] Set up HTML file with basic UI (title, button, output area)
- [x] Use SpeechRecognition API to listen to user voice
- [ ] Display transcribed text on the screen (event.results)
- [x] Add a button to start/stop listening

### ðŸŸ¡ Phase 2 â€“ Basic Commands
- [ ] Recognize simple commands (like "what time is it?")
- [ ] Use speechSynthesis to speak back a response
- [ ] Handle at least 3 commands:
  - [ ] "What time is it?" â†’ speak current time
  - [ ] "Tell me a joke" â†’ speak a random joke
  - [ ] "Open YouTube" â†’ open YouTube in new tab

### ðŸŸ  Phase 3 â€“ Error Handling
- [ ] Handle unrecognized commands (e.g., "Sorry, I didn't understand")
- [ ] Prevent duplicate responses on repeated inputs
- [ ] Handle cases where mic access is denied or browser doesn't support it

### ðŸ”µ Phase 4 â€“ Desktop-Style Polish
- [ ] Make it a clean, centered layout with basic CSS
- [ ] Add a status indicator: "Listeningâ€¦" or "Click to talk"
- [ ] Style output nicely (bigger text, maybe animated speech bubble)

### ðŸŸ£ Optional Features (Extra Fun)
- [ ] "Open Google", "Open Facebook", etc.
- [ ] "What day is it today?"
- [ ] Add a "dark mode" toggle via voice
- [ ] Play music with a voice command
- [ ] Save last commands to localStorage (history)

## Technologies Used

- HTML/CSS/JavaScript
- Web Speech API (SpeechRecognition and speechSynthesis)
- Tauri for desktop application packaging
- React for UI components

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or newer)
- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) for package management
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) for Tauri backend

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/voicecube.git
cd voicecube
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
bun install
```

3. Start the development server
```bash
bun run tauri dev
```

## Building for Production

To create a production build:

```bash
bun run tauri build
```

This will generate platform-specific installers in the `src-tauri/target/release/bundle` directory.

## Browser Compatibility

The Web Speech API is supported in:
- Chrome (desktop)
- Edge
- Safari (partial support)
- Firefox (requires enabling flags)
